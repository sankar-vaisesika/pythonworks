## Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy

### Shallow copy(surface level copy)

- creates a new object,but does not create copies of nested objects.
- changes in nested affect both copies

```
import copy

original=[[1,2],[3,4]]

shallow=copy.copy(original)

shallow[0][0]=99

print(original)

```

### Deep Copy(full copy)

- Creates a new object and recursively copies all nested objects

- changes in one do not affect the other

```
import copy

original=[[1,2],[3,4]]

deep=copy.deepcopy(original)

deep[0][0]=99

print(original)
```

# List comprehension

List comprehension is a concise way to create lists using a single line of code.
newlist = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]

```
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = []

for x in fruits:
  if "a" in x:
    newlist.append(x)

print(newlist)

```

```
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]

newlist = [x for x in fruits if "a" in x]

print(newlist)
```

## Range

syntax: range(start,stop,step)

```
x = range(3, 20, 2)
for n in x:
  print(n)

```

## Slicing

Slicing is used to extract a given sequence data type.

```
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:5])
```
```

lst = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print(lst[1:4])  # Output: [20, 30, 40]

tp = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(tp[2:])  # Output: (3, 4, 5)
```

# Different types of operators in Python
Python supports several types of operators, which can be broadly categorized as:

✅ Arithmetic Operators:
Used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.
+, -, *, /, %, //, **

✅ Comparison Operators:
Used to compare values.
==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

✅ Logical Operators:
Used to perform logical operations (and, or, not).
and, or, not

✅ Assignment Operators:
=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=

✅ Bitwise Operators:
Operates on bits and performs bit-by-bit operations.
&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>

✅ Membership Operators:
Used to test if a value is a member of a sequence (list, tuple, string, etc.).
in, not in

✅ Identity Operators:
Used to compare the memory locations of two objects.
is, is not

# Looping statements

1. for loop
Used to iterate over a sequence (like list, tuple, string, etc.)
```
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
 Output: 0 1 2 3 4
You can also use it with lists:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```
2. while loop
Repeats as long as the condition is true.
```
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```
🔁 for loop vs while loop

|Feature     | for loop  |  while loop|
|------------|-----------|------------|
|Used when   |Number of iterations is known|Number of iterations is unknown|
|syntax simplicity|Cleaner for sequences(list,strings)|Better for conditions|
|Typical usage|Iterating over a iterable objects|Repeating until a condition is false|
|Loop control|Works with range(),lists,strings etc.|Needs manual counter & update|
